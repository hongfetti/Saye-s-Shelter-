# <Saye's-Shelter>

## Description
So many pets find themselves stuck at shelters and we wanted to find a way to save them.
So many people want pets, but there's no good way to connect them to pets in need of a home, so we decided to build this project to connect them to each other.
Our project solves the problem of overcrowdig shelters and lack of adoption.
